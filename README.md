Java projects from 2020 Fall

Note: Please put all of the files into the same directory to run.

1) HiddenMarkov: This project uses hidden markov modelling and the viterbi algorithm to predict part of speech of a body of text.
   Currently, it is set to train the algorithm with the Brown Corpus, but you can train it with any two text and POS files.
   Additionally, you can test the performance/efficiency of this algorithm by implementing the fileBasedTest method in main.
   
2) Kevin Bacon Game: This project aims to implement the graph ADT and BFS algorithm to model the connectivity of the acting community.
   Utilizing a large dataset of actors and the movies they starred in, 
   it creates a graph in which the nodes are actors and the edges are movies (with Kevin Bacon set to the center of the universe by default).
   From this, the user can discover the degrees of separation between two actors, find paths between actors, find the most connected actors, and more.
   Note: the user can also implement this with other data sets by entering other text files and parsing accordingly
